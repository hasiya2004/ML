# 📚 Q&A Retrieval System

## 🌐 Overview

🛠 Developed by Hasindu Senarathne, this code provides a simple Q&A retrieval system using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) technique. The system can 🔍 find the closest match to a user's question from a given dataset and return the associated answer. 🗣️ It also provides an interactive loop for the user to ask questions and ➕ add new Q&A pairs to the dataset.

## 🌟 Features

- 📂 Load an existing Q&A dataset or create a new one.
- 🔍 Search for the closest matching question using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.
- 💬 Interactively ask questions.
- ➕ Add new Q&A pairs to the dataset.
- 💾 Save the updated dataset.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- 🐍 Python
- 🐼 pandas: `pip install pandas`
- 📊 scikit-learn: `pip install scikit-learn`

## 🚀 How To Use

1. 🏃‍♂️ Run the script.
2. 📝 Type in your question when prompted.
3. 🤖 If the system recognizes a similar question from the dataset, it will return the associated answer.
4. 📌 Type 'add' to add a new Q&A pair to the dataset.
5. 🚪 Type 'exit' to save the dataset and quit the program.

## 🏗 Structure

- 📂 **Loading Dataset**: The system first tries to load an existing `qa_dataset.csv`. If not found, it creates a new dataset with some predefined questions and answers.
- 📊 **TF-IDF Transformation**: The system transforms the questions using TF-IDF for similarity search.
- 📢 **Retrieving Answers**: Based on cosine similarity, the system finds the closest matching question from the dataset and returns its answer.
- 💬 **Interactive Loop**: The user can interact with the system to ask questions or add new Q&A pairs. The updated dataset is saved when exiting.

## 📋 Example Questions in the Dataset

- "❓how are you"
- "🌦 weather"
- "😂 joke"
- "🌱 photosynthesis"
- ... and many more.
